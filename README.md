# Simple calculator

This app was built with angular to learn angular and PWA.

HTML and CSS files are from https://www.techiediaries.com/angular-9-tutorial-and-example/ and slightly changed.

## Run on local server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Try PWA

Build app for production and run `npx http-server ./dist/angular-calculator/`

Essential package for angular pwa capabilities: `ng add @angular/pwa`
